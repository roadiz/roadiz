Roadiz is a modern CMS based on a polymorphic node system which can handle many types of services and contents.
Its back-office has been developed with a high sense of design and user experience.
Its theming system is built to live independently from back-office allowing easy switching
and multiple themes for one content basis. For example, it allows you to create one theme
for your desktop website and another one for your mobile, using the same node hierarchy.
Roadiz is released under MIT license, so you can reuse
and distribute its code for personal and commercial projects.
